                        This is not an exhaustive list, and how I feel about
                        things can change based on my headspace, mood, who I'm
                        with, and other factors.

                    <p>As with all things, <em>if in doubt, ask!</em></p>

                <h3>Generally okay</h3>

                    Unless I've said otherwise, I'm <em>generally</em> very
                    comfortable with the following things, irrespective of how

                    <p>
                        If you're scanning my collar its pretty likely that I'm
                        at an event of some sort (<em>oh hi furcons..</em>), so
                        the below is tailored towards random beings who I'm at
                        least comfy enough to let close enough to touch me with
                        a phone. Others who know me better probably already have
                        a more expansive idea on the things which are cool/not
                        cool to do to me :3
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we're <em>not</em> at an event, then this list is
                        going to feel pretty limited - this is by design, but it
                        hopefully gives you some ideas to work from in
                        communicating with me.

                            gear (e.g. a tail) which could potentially get
                            caught - I use breakaway clips for safety, but would
                            prefer to
                            <em>not</em> have to rely on them! :)

                    <p>
                        More than a few of my collars have additional meaning to
                        them (i.e. given to me by owners) and can put me into a
                        pup headspace, where its very unlikely I will want to
                        talk..

                    <p>I'll probably bark for you though! ^.^</p>

                        If I'm far enough in to a headspace to not verbally
                        respond, and you're trying to ask if its okay to do a
                        <em>{thing}</em> to me, you're going to have to assume
                        it's a <strong>no</strong>, or if one of my owners are
                        around, ask <em>them</em>.
